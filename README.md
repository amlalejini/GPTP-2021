## Abstract

> TODO

## Selection Schemes

This section discusses the kinds selection schemes we are analyzing in this project:

- Lexicase Selection
- Îµ-Lexicase Selection
- Novelty Search
- Epsilon Lexicase

## Diagnostic Problems
This section discusses the isolated component that different problems share.

- Exploitation
- Structured Exploitation
- Exploration
- Ecological Niche Filling

## Experimental Setup

A more detailed description of the experiment set up can be found [here](https://jgh9094.github.io/Selection-Scheme-Diagnotics-Part-I/Descriptions/experiment_setup.html).

## Preliminary Results

Below you will find the preliminary results that drive the final selection scheme parameters that we will be testing.
In each file there are statistics that provide evidence as to why each final selection scheme parameter is selected.
