## Abstract

## Selection Schemes

This section discusses the kinds selection schemes we are analyzing in this project:

- Lexicase Selection
- ε-Lexicase Selection
- Cohort Lexicase Selection
- Downsampled Lexicase Selection
- Novelty-Lexicase Selection

## Diagnostic Problems
The diagnostic we are using for this project.

- Exploration

## Preliminary Results

Below you will find the preliminary results that drive the final selection scheme parameters that we will be testing.
In each file there are statistics that provide evidence as to why each final selection scheme parameter is selected.
