## Abstract

> Evolutionary algorithms have demonstrated to ability to solve complex real-world optimization problems, sometimes presenting solutions that are unintuitive to a human designer.
> The difference between solving complex optimization problem and not can be heavily influenced by the kind of algorithm and its configuration.
> Hence, being able to piece together the best algorithm for a give optimization problem is key to solving it.
> One of the major pieces of an evolutionary algorithm, that many in fact share, is the selection of genetic material for the construction of a new population of solutions for the following generation -- otherwise known as a selection scheme.
> Over time, the complexity of selection schemes has grown to increase the robustness and efficiency when traversing the fitness landscape to find optimal solutions.
> The effectiveness of new selection schemes is usually illustrated with different sets of real-world problems, which can make it difficult to compare different schemes.
> While this approach demonstrates a selection scheme's ability to solve a complex optimization problem, understanding or visualizing the fitness landscape being traversed is difficult and may be impossible.
> In this work we present X diagnostic characteristic problems that focus on isolating problem characteristics that algorithms will encounter in a real-world optimization problem, so that we can better understand the strengths and weaknesses of different selection schemes.
> Five selection schemes are evaluated against these X different diagnostics, where different data is recorded to illustrate strengths and weaknesses.

## Selection Schemes

This section discusses the kinds selection schemes we are analyzing in this project. These selection schemes were selected because of we believe they
